# Little Lemon Restaurant Website

This repository contains the source code for the "Little Lemon" restaurant website, a fictitious restaurant created as part of the Coursera Certification for Front-End Developer offered by Meta. The project showcases a modern web application built with React, demonstrating key front-end development skills and technologies.

You can try out the Front End application at this [link](https://nickpolvani.github.io/little_lemon/).

The application at the moment supports the functionality to book a table. View pages below:
